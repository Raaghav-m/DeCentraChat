# **DeCentraChat**

Welcome to DeCentraChat
Your one-stop decentralized platform for AI-powered model inferences. With 0gLab's serving layer, experience seamless querying of AI models while leveraging decentralized infrastructure for reduced latency through multiple GPU service providers.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **0g Serving User Broker**: Enables decentralized AI model inferences by interacting with multiple GPU service providers.
- **0g Storage SDK**: Facilitates secure and decentralized storage of chat conversations and data.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language used for storing and retrieving root hashes on the blockchain.
- **Wagmi and Viem**: Provides React hooks and Ethereum utilities for seamless blockchain integration.
- **Next.js**: Framework used for building the frontend and server-side rendering for optimal performance.

## **Standout Feature**
- Stateful models-By default,the models in the 0g marketplace are stateless,meaning they are non-contextual. But with the help of 0g Storage,we solve this issue by saving the conversations in a decentralized way. This helps in users to access their old chats and backup their new ones.

- Validate responses -  Validate the responses with the help of the 0g sdk,which depends on the validity of the service provider and how the response was generated.This is denoted by a small check mark,near the response
